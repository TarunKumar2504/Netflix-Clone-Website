# Netflix-Clone-Website
Developed a responsive front-end replica of Netflix using only HTML and CSS.

Recreated key UI components including navigation bar, hero banner, movie thumbnails, and footer.

Applied modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox, Grid, and media queries to ensure cross-device compatibility.

Designed hover effects and layout interactions to mimic the original Netflix user experience.

Focused on pixel-perfect design and clean, maintainable code.
